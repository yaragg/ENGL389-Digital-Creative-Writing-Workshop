Here, where light itself doesn't dare tread, he is far away from the slavers that took him and forced him to speak. But the damage is already done: his voice is forever ruined. Now, his once enchanting song brings no joy but madness to all who hear it.</p><p>And still, he sings. His voice echoes up from the dark underwater caves. Perhaps that is how the inhabitants of the Depths are able to stand the darkness at all. Only madmen would ever survive there.</p>",
