Salen had absolutely no business doing anything shady with their results when all he wanted was credit and acknowledgement. Credit which he wasn't being given. He'd worked almost as much if not more than his so-called supervisor!</p><p>But, of course, his teacher wasn't willing to hear any of it. Salen had pointed out that if his magic made his research bad, leaving his name out and taking credit for it would only mean any failures with the project later would be seen as his teacher's fault. It was of no use, which really just proved the Shadirian's point: it was all an excuse. A very flimsy one at that.</p><p>He knew it was stupid, he did. But he stood facing two years' worth of hard work and research, and he just couldn't help it. If Mulfa wouldn't give him credit, well, Salen wouldn't let him get any either. With an angry cry, he knocked the table over, breaking delicate constructs and bottles, and what potions didn't shatter and spill he poured into one another, backing off only because of the stinking, probably toxic cloud. Scowling, he ripped handwritten rune scrolls and months' worth of notes to shreds and burned the rest. </p><p><i>Now</i> his work was done.</p>",
