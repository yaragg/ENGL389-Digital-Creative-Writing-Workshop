He has long shed his once wine red robes in favor of a grieving black, but they were never why he received his name.</p><p>Red is everything else: the world, when anyone is unfortunate enough to cross paths with him. Red is their bodies, if they are found at all. Red is <i>them</i>, the creatures his tormented, obsessive mind have thought into existence. And Red is alive, swallowing everything it touches even as it struggles to leave the tower into the sunlight.</p>",
