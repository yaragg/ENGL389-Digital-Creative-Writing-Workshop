He leaps forward and tries to catch it, but can only watch helplessly as his Runes &amp; Wards II homework flies over the railing and whooshes far away from the sky bridge.</p><p>Cursing, he sets down his books under a bench to shield them from the wind, then jumps over the railing.</p><p>Nobody bats an eyelid. A few arcane words and his feet start glowing; he runs across the air as if it were solid and catches his runaway homework. After getting back on the bridge, he tucks it safely between the pages of his textbooks and continues on his way as if nothing happened.</p><p>This is Arymyr, after all. In the land of mages, walking the air is only as odd as taking the longest way to class.</p>",
