	"content": "<p>One of the merchant Republics, along with Ladon, Salathsis and Shadir. Possessing many mage schools, it is Arymyr's strongest competitor, which is only compounded by Acurkiel's close ties to Arymyr's long-time enemy Saybir.</p><p>Unlike in Arymyr where mages reign supreme, Acurkiel combines both Saybir's wariness of magic and the merchant Republics' penchant for slavery.</p><p>It has two types of students: those who pay for their education and are free to leave, and those who have been sold as slaves and are only educated there to be resold later as expensive, knowledgeable mage slaves.</p><p>Their students are discriminated according to their type of magic: white and light mages are largely privileged and often sent back to work in high positions for the Saybiran church. On the other hand, necromancers are monitored very closely and live under the constant threat of \"vanishing\" if they step out of line. Their magic is sealed to prevent its use without permission, and there is only one way they ever leave their schools: dead or sold.</p>"
