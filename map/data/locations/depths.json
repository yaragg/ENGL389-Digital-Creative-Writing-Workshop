	"content" : "<p>The abyssal zone of the Iteian empire. There, hidden away in the cold and dark waters, live those the empire has rejected: disgraced leaders, political enemies, even just those who have nowhere else to live. A powerful barrier protects them from the immense pressure of deep water, but only Fate himself would lead them safely that far to begin with.</p><p>The inhabitants of the Depths have long sworn loyalty to Erillen, the so-called Empress of the Depths, who has offered a gentle and warm presence for those once desolate souls to rally under. Given the extent of the Depths, one could say her empire is even larger than Iteia itself.</p>"
